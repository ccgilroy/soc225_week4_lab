# Introduction

Exploratory data analysis, especially data visualization, is a way of understanding patterns and uncertainty in a data set. You can look at variation in the distribution of a single variable, and/or covariation across multiple variables. 

We'll practice doing this with two new data sets related to algorithms and bias. 

The best way to visualize covariation depends on whether your variables are categorical or numeric. This website has an elegant flow chart and examples: https://www.data-to-viz.com/

Today's exercises are inspired by these chapters:

- Chapter 7, Exploratory Data Analysis, of R for Data Science
  - http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html
- Chapters 5 and 6 of Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction
  - http://socviz.co/workgeoms.html
  - http://socviz.co/modeling.html

# Setup

Remember, most of the commands you use are in the various packages that are part of the tidyverse. Make sure to load the tidyverse (`library(tidyverse)`) if a command isn't found!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Data Set 1: COMPAS recidivism scores

ProPublica wrote a story called "Machine Bias" about the COMPAS algorithm, which predicts recidivism and is used to guide criminal sentencing: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing

They did a statistical analysis of racial disparities and wrote up those results here: https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm

They've released their data and code publicly on GitHub, which is good practice for data journalism and data science: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis

We've talked about this case before, but you should at least skim the story and analysis to make sure you understand the data you're looking at. 

## Read the data

You can use `read_csv` to read a CSV file from an online location by providing a URL instead of a file path. We'll do that instead of downloading the COMPAS data from the repository manually. 

```{r}
compas <- 
  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/propublica/compas-analysis/master/compas-scores-two-years.csv", 
           na = c("NA", "N/A"))
```

## Comparing Black and White defendants

Together, we'll write code to compare the distribution of risk scores between Black and White defendants. Our goal is to make something like the bar charts shown here: https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm

1. filter the data to look at only Black and White defendants
2. make a bar chart 
3. facet by race
4. clean up the axes and labels a bit

```{r}
compas %>%
  # -1 means that the score is missing, so we'll filter those values out
  filter(decile_score != -1) %>%
  # we'll write our code together here
  filter() %>%
  ggplot()
```

## Comparing men and women defendants

Let's apply the same approach to compare women and men. 

```{r}
compas %>%
  filter(decile_score != -1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = decile_score)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
  facet_wrap(~sex) + 
  labs(title = "COMPAS recidivism risk scores")
```

This isn't a great way to compare the two. Why not? Because the relative sizes of the groups are very different. 

### new verbs: `group_by` and `count`

Instead of counts, let's compare *proportions*. To do that, we'll need new `dplyr` verbs. 

`group_by` adds a grouping structure to a data frame. You can then use `mutate` or `summarize` on those groups.

`count` groups by a variable or variables, and then summarizes the number of rows in each group. It's the same as `group_by %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% ungroup()`. 

```{r}
compas %>% 
  count(sex, decile_score) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n/sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = decile_score, y = proportion)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

Now, it's clear that a larger proportion of women have lower risk scores. 

## Question: proportions by race

Modify the code above to plot proportions by race, instead of counts. This time, don't filter out any racial groups. 

```{r}
# write your code here
```

# Data Set 2: PASSNYC schools data

The non-profit PASSNYC is interested in improving access to education in New York City and in increasing the diversity of students taking the SHSAT exam for elite public schools. 

They've created a "Data Science for Good" challenge on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good/home

Read the overview for this challenge. We'll download their data and use it for exploratory analysis. 

Optionally, you can read more about testing and segregation in NYC public schools here: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/nyregion/what-is-the-shsat-exam-and-why-does-it-matter.html

##  Get and clean the data

To download the data, you'll need to create a Kaggle account. Download the data, unzip the files, and put them in your project folder. **You may need to adjust the file path you use to read the data.**

I've written some data cleaning code that you should run. `parse_number` turns percents and currencies into numbers. 

```{r}
schools_raw <- 
  read_csv("data/data-science-for-good/2016 School Explorer.csv", 
           na = c("NA", "N/A"))

schools <- 
  schools_raw %>%
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("Percent")), parse_number) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with("%")), parse_number) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with("Rate")), parse_number) %>%
  mutate(`School Income Estimate` = parse_number(`School Income Estimate`))
```

## Scatterplots and smoothing

Let's look at the association or *covariation* between two variables. The student attendance rate should be closely associated with the percent of students who are chronically absent.

Notice that variable names can't normally have spaces in them! Since these do, we surround the names with backticks (``). 

```{r}
schools %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Percent of Students Chronically Absent`, 
                    y = `Student Attendance Rate`)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

One school apparently has 0% attendance. If we filter out this outlier, then the trend is basically linear. 

```{r}
schools %>%
  filter(`Percent of Students Chronically Absent` != 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Percent of Students Chronically Absent`, 
                    y = `Student Attendance Rate`)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Economic need and race

These plots are based on a kernel by Randy Lao: https://www.kaggle.com/randylaosat/simple-exploratory-data-analysis-passnyc

The racial composition of a school is related to an index of economic need in a way that varies by race.  

```{r}
schools %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Economic Need Index`, y = `Percent White`)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

### new verb: `gather`

Alternative, we can plot covariation between racial composition and economic need for all racial groups simultaneously. But to do this, we need to rely on *tidy data* principles, and convert the data from **wide** to **long** format using `gather`. 

```{r}
schools %>%
  gather(key = "Race", value = "Percent", 
         `Percent Asian`, `Percent Black`, 
         `Percent Hispanic`, `Percent White`) %>%
  mutate(Percent = Percent/100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Economic Need Index`, y = Percent, color = Race)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~Race) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(title = "Student racial composition and economic need")
```

## Question: explore the PASSNYC data

Explore the PASSNYC data set a bit on your own. Get a sense for what variables it contains and what their distributions are. `View(schools)` and `names(schools)` are ways to do this in R, but the Kaggle page also has some information: https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good 

Then, pick two variables whose covariation you want to explore. Make a scatterplot. Add a trend, either a curve (the default `geom_smooth()`) or or a straight line (`geom_smooth(method = "lm")`). 

```{r}
# write your code here
```

# Challenge: run a model

Statistical models in R use a formula syntax (`z ~ x + y`). `lm` and `glm` are common modeling functions. Try out models incorporating multiple covariates on either of today's data sets. Print a summary of the results, and, if you're ambitious, try to visualize them. See http://socviz.co/modeling.html and http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html for how to do that.

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(decile_score ~ race + sex, data = filter(compas, decile_score != -1))
summary(fit1)
```
